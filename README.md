# Fitness-15

A fitness app that connects users with similar interests in physical activity with each other. Also provides locations of nearest gyms.

To demo the app, you have to have expo, node, and the required libraries installed (will add later). You also have to download the expo client on your phone or use a virtual machine. Then simply clone the repo using `git clone` then `expo start` in the cloned repo, scan the QR code and enjoy!
